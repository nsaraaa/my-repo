    <strong>Advanced Penetration Testing Framework</strong>
    <br>
    <em>Automated vulnerability detection and exploitation engine</em>
</div>

## 📋 Overview

**XploitStrike** is a powerful command-line based automated penetration testing tool designed to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in web applications. The framework leverages advanced machine learning models, including neural networks and transformers, to automatically generate payloads, mutate them, and classify vulnerabilities with high accuracy.

## ⚔️ Core Capabilities

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **SQLi** | Extracts SQL injection payloads from vulnerable sites, mutates them, and tests them using a neural network and reinforcement learning for classification and reporting |
| **XSS** | Generates unique XSS payloads using a transformer model and classifies them with a neural network |
| **MITM** | Network traffic interception with real-time analysis and packet inspection |
| **DDoS** | Network stress testing simulation with configurable attack parameters |
